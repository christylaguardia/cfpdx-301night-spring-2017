# Pair Programming

1. Driver: fork the CF Lab 03 repository if you haven't done so already.
1. Your **forked repo** on GitHub will be your "origin" repo. Clone **your fork** to your local development environment:
  1. If you haven't done so yet, create a directory named "301" - `mkdir 301/` (This will be your parent 301 directory and set you up for organizational success!)
  1. Next, `cd 301/`
  1. `git clone` this repo.
  1. `cd` into this repo.
  1. Immediately `git checkout -b <driverName-navigatorName>` (ex: `git checkout -b rick-brian`).

5. Complete the method for handling tab-based event navigation on the page.
6. Add an event to reveal a complete article if the user would like to see more than just a two-line teaser.


# Portfolio assignment for class 3

Continue building and improving your portfolio site. Here's how you can leverage events:

Adapt these stories as necessary to fit how you want to build your portfolio.

## User Stories: MVP
  1. As the creator, I want the Home and About nav links to act as tabs, so my story is revealed FAST.
    - This means your links do NOT navigate to a new page.
    - Instead, your "single page app" shows only the section related to the navigation tab that is selected.
    - You can use 'data-' attributes to associate a content section with a particular tab
    - Then use jQuery so when the tab is clicked, you hide all the sections, then reveal the associated section only.
  1. As a reader, I want the portfolio to use a nice color scheme, so that it stands out visually.

## Technical Requirements and Grading Rubric
  - Use event delegation whenever appropriate.
  - Add click handlers to at leat one nav section.
  - Do as much work as you can with advanced selectors, rather than littering your markup with classes and ids.
  - When classes and IDs are needed, pick semantic names. There is to be no `$('#content .content')` nonsense!
