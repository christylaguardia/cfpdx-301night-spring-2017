## Feature Tasks  
<!-- a list or description of the feature tasks you want the students to implement -->

1. Install ExpressJS, and ensure that it's been saved as a dependency in the `package.json` file.
1. Complete each of the TODOs in the `server.js` file.
1. Run the server using `node server` and ensure that your app functions correctly.

# Class 07 Portfolio assignment

## Your Portfolio for Class 7 - Give it a Node server!

Pretty simple adaptation for today's portfolio assignment: Set it up to run from a `server.js` file as we did with the blog app in lab.

This is a good day to get caught up on any lingering technical pieces of the portfolio.
